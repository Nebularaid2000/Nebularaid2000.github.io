Currently, I'm a third year Ph.D. student in Computer Science (CS) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com). Previously, I enrolled in the Dual Degree Program at University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI), in which I obtained a B.S.Eng. degree in CS at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a B.S.Eng. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests include:
- Explainable AI (XAI)
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
