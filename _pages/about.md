Currently, I'm a second year Ph.D. student major in Computer Science (CS) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com). Previously, I enrolled in the Dual Degree Program at University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI), in which I obtained a B.Eng. degree in CS at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a B.Eng. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
