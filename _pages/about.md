I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com). I'm a member of the [Lab for Interpretable Machine Learning](https://sjtu-xai-lab.github.io/). Previously, I enrolled in the Dual Degree Program at University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI), in which I obtained a B.S.Eng. degree in Computer Science at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and a B.S.Eng. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Currently, my research focuses on Explainable AI (XAI):
- Explaining artificial intelligence models (especially deep neural networks) with symbolic concepts
- Analyzing the dynamics of symbolic concepts learned by neural networks during the training process
- Manipulating/debugging neural networks at the concept level. 
- I also have a broad interest in general topics in machine learning, computer vision, and trustworthy large language models (LLMs).
