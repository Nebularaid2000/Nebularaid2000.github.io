Currently, I'm a Senior student major in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Insititute (UM-SJTU JI). I enrolled in the Dual Degree Program, in which I'm pursuing a second degree in Computer Science (CS) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I will receive the B.Eng. degree in CS in Apr. 2022 and the B.Eng. degree in ECE in Aug. 2022. After that, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
